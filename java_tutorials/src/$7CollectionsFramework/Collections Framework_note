// Collections Framework 

// The Java Collections Framework (JCF) is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections of objects in Java. It provides a set of classes and interfaces that make it easier to work with groups of objects, such as lists, sets, and maps. The framework is part of the java.util package and includes various data structures and algorithms for storing, retrieving, and manipulating data efficiently.
// Key Components of the Collections Framework:
// 1. Interfaces: The core interfaces in the Collections Framework include Collection, List, Set, Map, Queue, and Deque. These interfaces define the basic operations that can be performed on different types of collections.
// 2. Implementations: The framework provides several concrete implementations of the core interfaces, such as ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap, and TreeMap. Each implementation has its own characteristics and performance trade-offs.
// 3. Algorithms: The Collections Framework includes a set of algorithms for sorting, searching, and manipulating collections. These algorithms are implemented as static methods in the Collections class.
// 4. Utility Classes: The framework also provides utility classes like Collections and Arrays that offer static methods for working with collections and arrays, respectively.
// Commonly Used Collections:
// - List: An ordered collection that allows duplicate elements. Common implementations include ArrayList and LinkedList.
// - Set: A collection that does not allow duplicate elements. Common implementations include HashSet and TreeSet.
// - Map: A collection that maps keys to values. Common implementations include HashMap and TreeMap.
// - Queue: A collection that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Common implementations include LinkedList and PriorityQueue.
// Benefits of Using the Collections Framework:
// - Simplified Code: The framework provides ready-to-use data structures and algorithms, reducing the need for custom implementations.
// - Improved Performance: The framework's implementations are optimized for performance, making it easier to work with large datasets.
// - Flexibility: The use of interfaces allows for easy swapping of different implementations based on specific requirements.
// - Consistency: The unified architecture ensures a consistent approach to working with different types of collections.
